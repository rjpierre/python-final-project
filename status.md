Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

For my part of the group project, I have figured out a way to get the user to input an image from their computer using the tkinter module in Python.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Since I found out that tkinter can only handle .png files, I am going to explore other methods of getting an image as a user input, such as Pillow. I also need to figure out how to display the modified image in a new window for the user to see. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I had the problem with tkinter only accepting .png files, since most images of memes come in .jpg files. I am working on getting Pillow to install in Python. The instructions to install it were confusing at first but I think I got it figured out. I just have to see if it works.
