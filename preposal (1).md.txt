# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

- Meme Fryer or make a deep fried meme
- something music related, maybe in Max msp
- maybe build something off of magenta 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

- Nick Kruse
- Sean McLaughlin

## Do you have any questions of your own?

When I looked at the stuff on magenta, I really didn't understand the code in the 
collab notebooks. Maybe we could use help with that? I think we might just go with 
the meme fryer though because it's fun and we are capable of figuring that out.
