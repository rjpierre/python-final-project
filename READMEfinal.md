Rebecca: I learned a lot about how to use Pillow to manipulate pictures in Python for this project. At first it was hard to figure out the names of the functions we needed from Pillow to get the filters we wanted, but with some research (aka googling) I was able to figure it out. The only issue the program has is that it takes a long time to process pictures that are big and/or have lots of different colors, which kind of sucks for some of the pictures we wanted to deep fry. Nonetheless, I am really happy with how our project came out. 

Sean: We used a modified version of the process 10 function from our runestone project 1 for our deepfry function.

Nick: This project was fun because I got to explore pillow and image manipulation more in Python. Getting the text to look right was tedious, but I’m happy with how it turned out in the end. It took me a long time to figure out how to center the text on the deep-fryed meme. The issue was that I wasn’t able to figure out the exact math for how many pixels my font sizes were, so sometimes text is centered right rather than dead center. Overall, I’m really happy with this project and I can’t wait to share it with my friends.
