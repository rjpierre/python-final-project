Rebecca: I learned a lot about how to use Pillow to manipulate pictures in Python for this project. At first it was hard to figure out the names of the functions we needed from Pillow to get the filters we wanted, but with some research (aka googling) I was able to figure it out. The only issue the program has is that it takes a long time to process pictures that are big and/or have lots of different colors, which kind of sucks for some of the pictures we wanted to deep fry. Nonetheless, I am really happy with how our project came out. 

Sean: We used a modified version of the process 10 function from our runestone project 1 for our deepfry function.

Nick: It took me a long time to figure out how to center the text on the deep-fryed meme.
