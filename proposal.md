# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Meme Fryer

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that can take any picture or meme and deep fry it, which means the picture will be run through many filters until it becomes grainy, discolored, and washed out.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will take a picture and apply certain filters to the picture. First, the program will accept a picture that the user inputs or a picture that is preloaded in the program if python cannot accept an image as an input. Next, certain filters will be applied to the picture one by one or applied all at once if possible. Then, the new image will be displayed to the user in a new window either finished or as the image is changing. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Run a number of certain filters through a picture and display it in a new window to the user.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Let the user choose a picture out of a list of pre-selected pictures and run that picture through the deep fryer filters to display a new version of the picture in a new window.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Ask the user's input for a picture or meme of their choice, run that picture through the deep fryer filters, and display this new version of the picture in a new window. 

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

Our next steps as a group will be to delegate who focuses on what part of the project. One person will need to research what filters are typically used in a meme deep fryer. Another person will need to figure out the code needed to apply these filters to a picture. The third person will probably need to figure out if the program can accept a picture as an input or if the user will have to choose between certain preloaded pictures in the program.
